        <p class="collectionIntro__text core">The rain and mist are the only constants in these landscapes, shifting in an endless cycle. At first, the Ardennes seem untouched by warmth—yet, beneath the quiet, there's a sense of belonging. You feel it in the people, in the simple joys of life, in the unspoken connection of shared moments. No matter where you're from, this place feels like home.</p>

        <p class="collectionIntroText__core core">Wandering through the misty forests of the Belgian Ardennes, he moves carefully, camera in hand, searching for the perfect shot. The air is crisp, the only sounds are the rustling leaves and the distant calls of ducks. Framed through his lens, they seem almost frozen in time until the buzz of his phone breaks the moment. A message from his friends.</p>
        <p class="collectionIntroText__core core">Meanwhile, in a cozy restaurant tucked away in a small village, the scene is already unfolding. Behind the counter, a chef arranges wooden planks of Ardennes charcuterie—cured meats, rich cheeses, fresh bread—all carefully laid out in preparation. The scent of slow-cooked flavors fills the air as the door swings open. He’s here. Plates arrive, laughter mixes with the warmth of the place, but the real moment is still ahead. The box is placed on the table, anticipation building. As the lid lifts, the fabric unfolds, revealing the design they’ve all been waiting for. A shared look, a knowing nod—this is more than just a T-shirt. It’s a story, a moment, a piece of everything they love about this place.</p>

        <h2 class="collectionAbout__subtitle subtitle"> Historical Landmarks</h2>
        <p class="collectionAbout__core core">The Belgian Ardennes have long stood as a place of mystery and beauty, their rolling hills and dense forests holding stories as old as time. Shrouded in mist and shaped by the passage of history, this region is more than just a landscape, it is a living testament to nature's quiet resilience. The rivers carve their way through valleys, their waters reflecting the ever-changing sky, while towering trees whisper with the wind, carrying secrets of centuries past.
        <br><br>
        Among the forests and winding waterways, deer move silently through the undergrowth, wild boars rustle through the leaves, and birds of prey soar overhead, watching from above. Ducks, a familiar sight in the region's many ponds and rivers, glide effortlessly across the water, their reflections rippling with each gentle movement.</p>

        <p class="collectionAbout__core core"> Whether wandering through its forests, sharing a meal by the fire, or simply watching the mist roll in over the hills, the feeling remains the same. No matter where you come from, the Ardennes have a way of making you feel at home.</p>
        <div class="collectionAbout__img"></div>
        <h2 class="collectionAbout__subtitle subtitle"> A Story Worth Telling</h2>
        <p class="collectionAbout__core core">While the Ardennes are known for the battles that once shook their soil, they are also a place of warmth, where traditions endure and hospitality runs deep. Small villages with stone houses and wooden beams invite visitors to slow down, to step inside and savor the simple pleasures of life. The region is rich in culinary delights—game meat, fresh trout, and the unmistakable scent of slow-cooked stews filling the air. Local cheeses, crafted with time-honored techniques, pair perfectly with a glass of Belgian beer, brewed in monasteries that have stood for generations.</p>

        <h2 class="collectionDesign__subtitle subtitle">Design Process</h2>
        <p class="collectionDesign__core core">Our design process for this collection was inspired by the ruggedness of the Belgian Ardennes. We embraced rough edges and exaggerated lines, a style that extends to our typography as well.</p>
        <p class="collectionDesign__core core">To achieve this effect for our ducks, we used thresholding to reduce the images to their essential outlines. Staying true to the collection’s aesthetic, we then traced over the designs by hand, amplifying the details to enhance their raw, expressive character.
        <br><br>
        This approach allows us to capture the essence of the Ardennes—untamed, textured, and deeply immersive. Every element, from the graphics to the garments themselves, reflects the raw beauty of the landscape that inspired them.</p>
